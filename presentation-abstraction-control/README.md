## Intent

**Presentation–abstraction–control** (**PAC**) is a software [architectural pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern_(computer_science)). It is an interaction-oriented software architecture, and is somewhat similar to [model–view–controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller) (MVC) in that it separates an interactive system into three types of components responsible for specific aspects of the application's functionality. The **abstraction** component retrieves and processes the data, the **presentation** component formats the visual and audio presentation of data, and the **control** component handles things such as the flow of control and communication between the other two components.
